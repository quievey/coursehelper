<p> Information and Computer Science (ICS) or Computer and Information Science (CIS) (plural forms, i.e. Sciences, may also be used) is a field that emphasizes both computing and informatics, upholding the strong association between the fields of information sciences and computer sciences and treating computers as a tool rather than a field.</p>
<p>Computer science (CS) spans the range from theory through programming to cutting-edge development of computing solutions. Computer science offers a foundation that permits graduates to adapt to new technologies and new ideas. The work of computer scientists falls into three categories:  </p>
<ol>
<li> Designing and building software;  </li>
<li> Developing effective ways to solve computing problems, such as storing information in databases, sending data over networks or providing new approaches to security problems; and </li>
<li> Devising new and better ways of using computers and addressing particular challenges in areas such as robotics, computer vision, or digital forensics (although these specializations are not available in all computer science programs). Most computer science programs require some mathematical background.</li>
</ol>
<p>One can get expertise in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>artificial intelligence</li>
<li>computer security</li>
<li>data intensive systems</li>
<li>health informatics</li>
<li>information retrieval & seeking</li>
<li>mathematically structured programming</li>
<li>mobile interaction</li>
<li>software engineering</li>
<li>library studies</li>
</ul>
<h4>Courses Available</h4>
<p> The courses available in this field include : Bachelor Of Business Information Technology,Bachelor Of Science(Business Information Systems)   Bachelor Of Science In Information Science   Bachelor Of Technology (Information Technology)  Bachelor Of Science (Information Technology) </p>
